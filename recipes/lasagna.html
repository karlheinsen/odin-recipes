    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a faster, and less expensive lasagna.
        <br>
        <br>
        Very good lasagna! My husband & I enjoyed it very much. I made a few changes, I used ground turkey instead of
        ground beef and also used Barilla lasagna oven ready-no boil noodles.I then added sliced mushrooms and shredded
        parmesan cheese. This recipe was very fast & easy to make! I'd recommend this to anyone. This one is definetly a
        keeper!
